## What is Archivald?

Archivald is a CLI tool that helps you generate Discord.js projects faster, with a set of buil-in templates, ready for you to use!

## Why did I decided to make Archivald?

With the new changes presented by Discord.js 14 and forward, creating a Discord bot has become slightly difficult, specially if we take into account the extreme code changes that the D.JS team implements. A D.JS developer spends most of their time rewriting code and implementing changes rather than coding the actual bot.

Archivald aims to elimite the tedious task of writing the basics, allowing any developer to quickly bootstrap a project with a direct connection to a database and the latest features of D.JS. As a wise man said once: "It just works".

## Archivald IS NOT

- **A framework**. This is a CLI tool that generates a template.
- **A library**.
- **Replacement for coding**. Archivald is not a discord bot maker or builder, it generates a JavaScript sample, all the fun stuff needs to be done by you.

## Installing Archivald

Start by running `npm install -g archivald` on your terminal or CMD, this will install Archie globally.

- Create a new project by running `archivald create`
- Give your project a cool and original name
- Paste your bot token, this will then be stored in a .env file
- Choose a databse template, you can use MongoDB, MySQL or a basic template that uses no database
- Done! You are ready to start working on your bot.
